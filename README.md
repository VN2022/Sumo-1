### SUMO → Perception Data Pipeline

This repository contains a reproducible pipeline for generating vehicle trajectory data using **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)** and converting it into formats suitable for **perception, mobility analysis, and downstream ML/MATLAB processing**.

The project is designed to be **platform-independent** using Docker, and was validated on **macOS (Apple Silicon)**.
